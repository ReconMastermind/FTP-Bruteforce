# Im not responsible for any for your actions, this tool is made for educational purposes only

for this tool to do its job, you need to download the libcurl development package

by executing ``sudo apt install libcurl-dev`` if you are on debian

then compiling the main.c file by executing `` gcc main.c -o main -lcurl ``
then just execute it by ./main and its all pretty straight forward

you just need a username wordlist and a password wordlist

this tool is kind of slow but i will upload an threaded version which will make it faster so stay tuned for updates

and remember im not responsible for any stuff you with this tool, i have only made it for beginners to understand and test their servers for any weakpoints
